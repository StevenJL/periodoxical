# Periodoxical

_"Up, and down, and in the end, it's only round and round and round..._" - Pink Floyd, "Us and Them"

Generate periodic dates/times based on rules. Great for (but not limited to) calendar and scheduling applications. 
See Usage for examples/details.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'periodoxical'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install periodoxical

## Usage

**Example 1:** As a Ruby dev, I want to generate all the datetimes blocks of 9:00AM - 10:30AM and 2:00PM - 2:30PM, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, between the dates of May 23, 2024 and June 12, 2024, inclusive.

This can be represented visually as:

<div align="center">
  <img width="558" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 10 55 45 PM" src="https://github.com/StevenJL/periodoxical/assets/2191808/e92fc6ff-03fd-44ed-a955-d3a0dd0f5d0a">
</div>


```rb
Periodoxical.generate(
  time_zone: 'America/Los_Angeles',
  days_of_week: %w[mon wed thu],
  time_blocks: [
    {
      start_time: '9:00AM',
      end_time: '10:30AM'
    },
    {
      start_time: '2:00PM',
      end_time: '2:30PM'
    }
  ],
  start_date: Date.parse('2024-05-23'),
  end_date: Date.parse('2024-06-12')
)
# returns an array of hashes, each with :start and :end keys
#=> 
[
  {
    start: #<DateTime: 2024-05-23T09:00:00-0700">,
    end:   #<DateTime: 2024-05-23T22:30:00-0700">,
  },
  {
    start: #<DateTime: 2024-05-23T14:00:00-0700>,
    end:   #<DateTime: 2024-05-23T14:30:00-0700>,
  },
 {
    start: #<DateTime: 2024-05-27T09:00:00-0700>,
    end:   #<DateTime: 2024-05-27T22:30:00-0700>
 },
 ...
 {
    start: #<DateTime: 2024-06-12T14:00:00-0700>,
    end:   #<DateTime: 2024-06-12T14:30:00-0700>
 }
]
```

Generate the next 3 datetime blocks of 9:00AM - 10:30AM and 2:00PM - 2:30PM on Sundays, after May 23, 2024
using the `limit` key.

```rb
Periodoxical.generate(
  time_zone: 'America/Los_Angeles',
  days_of_week: %w[sun],
  time_blocks: [
    {
      start_time: '9:00AM',
      end_time: '10:30PM'
    },
    {
      start_time: '2:00PM',
      end_time: '2:30PM'
    }
  ],
  start_date: Date.parse('2024-05-23'),
  limit: 3
)
# =>
[
  {
    start: #<DateTime: 2024-05-26T09:00:00-0700>,
    end:   #<DateTime: 2024-05-26T22:30:00-0700>,
  },
  {
    start: #<DateTime: 2024-05-26T14:00:00-0700>,
    end:   #<DateTime: 2024-05-26T14:30:00-0700>,
  },
  {
    start: #<DateTime: 2024-06-02T09:00:00-0700>,
    end:   #<DateTime: 2024-06-02T22:30:00-0700>,
  },
]
```
